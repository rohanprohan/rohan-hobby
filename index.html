        <h2>Why I Love Playing Guitar</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> Playing guitar is like a meditation each day I get to relax and enjoy the process.</li>
            <li> When Iâ€™m upset it helps me resolve my feelings.</li>
            <li>It allows me to speak my mind, so to speak, without having to say anything.</li>
